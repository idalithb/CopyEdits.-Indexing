# Indexing 101

[IndexerDAO](https://www.indexerdao.com/) has launched a comprehensive tutorial series called **Indexing 101**. 

Its primary goal is to assist new [indexers](https://thegraph.com/docs/en/network/indexing/) in getting started with [The Graph protocol](https://thegraph.com/en/). The series covers a wide range of topics, from Linux basics and containers to subgraph allocation management and indexing strategy. The tutorial series is accompanied by YouTube videos and live virtual teaching sessions, which offer learners an interactive learning experience and an opportunity to ask questions and receive feedback in real-time. 

The tutorial's community-driven approach ensures that the content is regularly updated and remains relevant as the network evolves over time; this approach makes **Indexing 101** an essential resource for anyone looking to become an indexer in The Graph protocol.
