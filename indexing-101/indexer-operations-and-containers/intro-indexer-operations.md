# Wallets Overview
It is crucial to understand that **wallets** are essential and necessary tools to securely manage and access Ethereum accounts. 

Ethereum wallets within the Web3 ecosystem are applications that allow you access to your account. They function like physical wallets where your identification and assets are held. Wallets allow you to sign into apps, view balances, send transactions, and verify your I.D. 

It’s helpful to think of wallets as windows to view and manage your assets on Ethereum, and _**not**_ as an Ethereum account. So, a wallet allows you to use the keys associated with your Ethereum account to interact with it. 

However, most wallet products will let you generate an Ethereum account, so you don't need one before you download a wallet. 

There are several types of wallets and they each have their pros/cons. 
  - Physical hardware wallets are physical devices that allow you to keep your crypto offline and they are the most secure.
  - Mobile application wallets allow you to easily access your accounts.
  - Browser wallets are web applications that allow you interact with your account directly on a browser.
  - Broser extension wallets are extensions that you download to interact with your account through a browser.
  - Desktop applications allow you to manage your funds from your macOS, Windows, or Linux system. 

_Keep this in mind as we move forward, and we review the differences between hot and cold wallets._

## Hot Wallets ##

Hot wallets are online wallets that are _**always**_ connected to the internet; they can be web-based, mobile, or a desktop app. They have private keys that grant you access to your blockchain address and all your digital assets. 

#### Types of Hot Wallets ####
  - Web Wallets: Allow you access to your account via web browser. They are provided by various online platforms such as MyEtherWallet, MetaMask, and Trust Wallet
  - Mobile Wallets: Apps that allow you quick on-the-go access to your account such as Trust Wallet and Coinbase Wallet

**Pros:**
  - They are highly convenient
  - Give you quick access 

**Cons:**
  - They are more vulnerable to cyber-attacks and hacks
  - They are considered less secure compared to cold wallets  

### Function & Security ###

You typically download and install hot wallets on your computer, smartphone, or use online wallet services.
When setting up the wallet, you generate a cryptographic key pair:
  - **Public Key:** Allows you to receive assets. This is the wallet address where others can send cryptocurrency to you.
  - **Private Key:** Authorizes direct access to assets within a blockchain address; it is used to access and control the funds in the wallet. This is a secret key that you must keep secure and never share with anyone. 

There are two broad categories of hot wallets, based on how you can access your account’s private keys: 

**Custodial wallets**, also known as hosted wallets or third-party wallets, are crypto exchange wallets like Binance and Coinbase. With this type of wallet, the third-party provider holds and manages your cryptocurrency assets on your behalf. They allow you to view your public keys, but the custodian or wallet provider controls the private keys. You access your wallet via login credentials, but it has no direct link to the address on the blockchain where your funds are stored. 
Essentially, you rely on the custodian to facilitate access. These types of wallets are designed to be user-friendly and more accessible.
