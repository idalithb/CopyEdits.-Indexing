# Wallets Overview
It is crucial to understand that **wallets** are essential and necessary tools to securely manage and access Ethereum accounts. 

Ethereum **wallets** within the Web3 ecosystem are applications that allow you access and control your account. They function like physical wallets where your identification and assets are held. Wallets allow you to sign into apps, view balances, send transactions, and verify your I.D. 

It’s helpful to think of wallets as windows to view and manage your assets on Ethereum, and _**not**_ as an Ethereum account. So, a wallet allows you to use the keys associated with your Ethereum account to interact with it. 

However, most wallet products will let you generate an Ethereum account, so you don't need one before you download a wallet. 

There are several types of wallets and they each have their pros/cons. 
  - Physical hardware wallets are physical devices that allow you to keep your crypto offline and they are the most secure.
  - Mobile application wallets allow you to easily access your accounts.
  - Browser wallets are web applications that allow you interact with your account directly on a browser.
  - Broser extension wallets are extensions that you download to interact with your account through a browser.
  - Desktop applications allow you to manage your funds from your macOS, Windows, or Linux system. 

_Keep this in mind as we move forward, and we review the differences between hot and cold wallets._
