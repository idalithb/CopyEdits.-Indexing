# Linux and Ethereum Clients

Linux and Ethereum clients are vital components of the web3 infrastructure. To understand their importance, it's useful to understand their relationship. 

Web3 powers decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum network. Linux is an open-source operating system that is widely used in the development and deployment of web3 infrastructure due to its stability, security, and flexibility. Ethereum clients, on the other hand, are software applications that enable interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. These clients are responsible for validating transactions, executing smart contracts, and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain. 

Together, Linux and Ethereum clients form the foundation of web3 infrastructure and support the growth of the decentralized internet.

In this unit, we will cover the fundamentals of Linux and Ethereum clients:

| Lesson | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ***Introduction to Linux***  | Covers basic commands, file system navigation, and permissions |
| ***Getting Started with Ethereum Clients*** | Provides an overview of commonly used clients |
| ***Lab 1: Sync a Gnosis Blockchain Node*** | Allows you to apply their knowledge and practice syncing a blockchain node to the Gnosis network using Nethermind |

By understanding the principles behind Linux and Ethereum clients, you will be equipped with the necessary skills to contribute to the development and maintenance of web3 infrastructure.
